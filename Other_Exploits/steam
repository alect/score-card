Steam is a desktop game distribution platform. The SDK provides many features
to game developers, like achievements, downloadable content, and leaderboards.

Examples of Steam leaderboards:
- <http://steamcommunity.com/stats/SuperMeatBoy/leaderboards/28829/>
- <http://steamcommunity.com/stats/Magicka/leaderboards/28597/>
- <http://steamcommunity.com/stats/Portal2/leaderboards/47459/>
The existence of negative scores (for portals used, where lower is better) and
2^31-1 scores (where higher is better) implies these leaderboards aren't
difficult to cheat.

We tested Steam using the game Super Meat Boy because it's one of the few games
I own that uses the leaderboard functionality. We captured the score submission
with Wireshark; the dump files are included here.

Unfortunately, the UDP packets sent by the game appear to use some sort of
unknown binary protocol, which doesn't contain the actual high score achieved
in any obvious encoding. (It's possible that this varies between games.) An
online search revealed no documentation of this protocol, although it might be
available to game developers who have partnered with Valve. As a result, we
don't know exactly what security features Steam incorporates, although the
opaque wire protocol is a good first layer of defense.
