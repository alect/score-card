From the website:
  Game Maker Online scoreboard is a free service for arcade style games that
  wish to display a perminant scoreboard for their players. Each GM Scoreboard
  account can list the top 50 scores for their game, which is easily updated
  from within their game client.

Scores are submitted via a simple HTTP request, e.g.
  http://gmscoreboard.com/handle_score.php?tagid=<XXX>&player=<XXX>&score=<XXX>
The tagid is a "secret" that is embedded in the game and not user-visible. For
example, the game "Ratio Speed Challenge" has "ratiospeedchallenge5t1h9".

However, it's easy to log the network requests made by a game, either with
developer tools for a browser game, or something like Wireshark. The tagid is
sent in the clear as a URL parameter, so it's trivial to use it to submit fake
scores.

There appear to be no other security measures. In fact, you can submit
non-numeric scores (they display as 0, but sort weirdly).
