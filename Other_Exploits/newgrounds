Newgrounds hosts browser-based Flash games. It's fairly open and has a
documented API, including an optional built-in scoreboard.

Unfortunately, we couldn't find a game on the site that actually uses the
scoreboard functionality. The API documentation suggests that each game has a
secret key embedded in the Flash binary, which is used to encrypt communication
with the Newgrounds servers.

Since the Flash binary is downloaded and runs locally, it's theoretically
possible to extract the key and spoof messages. However, the key provides some
practical security. Since we couldn't observe this functionality in action, we
don't know how the actual network protocol works.
