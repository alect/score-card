The Game Center provides network functionality for games on Apple devices.
Naturally, it contains a leaderboard API.

From the documentation at <https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/GameKit_Guide/LeaderBoards/LeaderBoards.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008304-CH6-SW19>:
  When you design a game that reports scores to Game Center, you should also
  consider the security needs of your game. You want scores reported to Game
  Center to be an accurate accounting of how players are doing. Here are two
  suggestions:
  - Store your game’s preferences and saved games in a secure format, rather
    than in clear text. If your game’s data is stored in clear text, a player
    can download the save game data using iTunes, modify it, and resync it back
    to the device. This may allow the player to score a higher score than you
    intended.
  - Always set reasonable minimum and maximum values for a leaderboard.

This suggests that the Game Center API itself provides fairly little security.
However, because of the extra difficulty of investigating software running on
a non-general-purpose mobile device, we didn't explore it ourselves.

This app for jailbroken devices can post any score to any game leaderboard.
