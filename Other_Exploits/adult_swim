Adult Swim hosts browser-based Flash games. It appears not to have any
documented API, but supports leaderboards for the games it hosts.

Score submission works by making an HTTP request that looks like
  http://highscores.adultswim.com/highscores/SubmitScoreServlet.do?attr1=<XXX>
The attr1 parameter looks like
  score=<XXX>|gameId=<XXX>|timestamp=<XXX>|key=<XXX>
The score, gameId, and timestamp are self-explanatory. The key is some hex
value, probably a hash or signature incorporating score, gameId, timestamp,
and submitting user. Presumably the algorithm and/or secret used to produce
this key is in the game binary somewhere, and could be extracted with some
effort.

Replaying a score submission, either on the same account or another account,
didn't seem to have any effect. However, replaying with a modified score or
timestamp would (sometimes, inconsistently) permanently clear the account's
high score list. That is, it would invalidate all past and future scores
posted from that account. This alone seems like a fairly effective deterrent,
since in order to experiment and find exploits, an attacker would have to go
through the trouble of making multiple single-use accounts. However, not
knowing the details of how the key is generated, we don't know if there are
any "hard" security features involved.
